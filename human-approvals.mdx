title: 'Human Approvals'
---

AI is incredibly powerful but can sometimes hallucinate. How can we get the best of both worlds: agents that automate our work but also 100% confidence that an agent doesn't do something we don't want it to? Enter: **Human Approvals**.

All Zeus agents can optionally be configured to ask for your approval before taking specific actions. Agents automate, humans review. 

### How does it work?
1. Turn on the "Human Approvals" toggle in the agent configuration
2. Specify which actions need your approval e.g. "don't send emails without my approval" or "don't refund the customer without my approval"
3. Zeus will notify you when an agent wants to take an action that requires approval
4. You quickly approve, reject, or modify the action
5. The agent will follow your instructions and continue with the rest of the automation.

### What actions can I configure approvals for?
Whatever you'd like. Users often configure their agents to ask for approvals before taking irreversible actions like sending an email, posting to social media, or making a payment.

### Will the agents learn from my approvals?
Yes! Every time you approve/deny/modify an action, Zeus will learn from your feedback. Your approval rate should go up and once it reaches 100%, you can turn off Human Approvals and have your agent run autonomously.

### Awesome! So what's next?
