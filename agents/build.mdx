title: 'Build'

**âš¡ Zeus** is the fastest way to build and deploy AI agents.

The "Build" step is where you configure the agent. This is where you define the following:
1. [Model](#model)
2. [Prompts](#prompts)
3. [Tools](#tools)
4. [Knowledge](#knowledge)
5. [Voice](#voice)
6. [Handoffs](#handoffs)
7. [Guardrails](#guardrails)


## Model
The Model is underling Large Language Model (LLM) that will be used to power the agent. You can select between models from OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google.

We recommend starting with OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini. It's cheap and fast. If you're looking for a more advanced model, you should use OpenAI's GPT-4o or o3-mini.

## Prompts

The Prompts are the instructions that will be used to guide the agent. The system prompt is the initial prompt that will be used to guide the agent. The user prompt is the prompt that will be used to guide the agent during the conversation.
