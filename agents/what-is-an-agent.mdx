# What is an Agent?

An agent is an autonomous AI system designed to perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with users or other systems. Unlike simple models that respond to prompts, agents maintain context, use tools, access information, and can execute complex workflows. Our platform enables you to create agents that combine large language models with specialized capabilities to solve real-world problems.
