Agents are the core building block of Zeus. They are used to automate your work.

## What is an agent?

An agent is a collection of tools, triggers, and instructions that automate a specific task.

## Agent Architecture

Agents are composed of the following components:
- **Prompt**: The instructions that guide the agent's behavior and decision-making
- **Knowledge Base**: Additional information an agent can reference like uploaded documents, an excel sheet, or your company's internal knowledge base.
- **Tools**: Allow agents to take specific actions like creating a record in Salsforce, searching your email history, or finding someone's LinkedIn. Zeus has 100+ built-in tools you can use. 
- **Sub-agents**: Other specialized agents that can be called by the main agent
- **Memory**: The agent's memory of previous interactions and tasks.


Agents are triggered by a trigger. Triggers can be a webhook, a scheduled task, or a user action.
