title: 'Building Good Agents'
---

Agents are incredibly powerful. If implemented correctly they can save you hundreds of hours. But they can be tricky to get right. Here are some tips for building good agents.

### How do I write a good agent prompt?
Clearly describe the end outcome you want your agent to achieve. The agent will keep iterating until it gets there. Make sure to be really specific about the end outcome. If you can imagine a scenario where the agent achieves the end outcome you've described but you'd still be unhappy, then you need to be more specific. 

### How do I make sure my agent doesn't do something I don't want it to?
Two ways: 
1. **Guardrails**. Write rules and constraints for your agent to follow. For example, you can tell your agent to only send emails to people in a certain list.
2. **Human approvals**. Have your agent ask for your review before taking specific actions. For example, before sending an email, the agent will ask for your approval first. This is called "human in the loop".
