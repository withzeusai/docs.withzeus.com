  <Step title="Define What Your Agent Will Do">
    Describe exactly what you want your agent to accomplish. Include what should trigger the agent to run, what tasks you want the agent to do, and the apps you want it to connect with.
    
    **Example**
    > *Every morning at 7am send me a prep email with a summary of everyone I'm meeting with that day. Research each person's LinkedIn, my notes on them in Salesforce, my previous email interactions with them, and recent news about the company they work for.*

<Tip>Yes, this is so simple but it actually works! Think of an agent like your own personal assistant: it can search the web, interact with the apps you use, respond to questions, and reason through complex problems. It's up to you to describe what you want it to do.</Tip>

### This seems great, but how do I avoid an agent doing something I don't want it to?
Agents are powerful, but they can be tricky to get right. That's why we built [**human approvals**](/human-approvals). Human Approvals allows you to build powerful agents that automate your work, but configure them to ask for your approval before taking specific actions.
