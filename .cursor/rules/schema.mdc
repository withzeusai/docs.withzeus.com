Best Practices
When configuring your docs.json file, consider these best practices:

Keep the configuration organized by grouping related settings together
Use meaningful names for groups and pages in your navigation structure
Provide complete paths for all assets (logos, favicons, etc.)
Test your configuration in both light and dark modes
Verify all external links and integrations are correctly configured
Use appropriate color contrasts for accessibility
Configure SEO settings for better search engine visibility
​
Validation
The docs.json file is validated against a JSON schema to ensure proper configuration. You can reference the schema by including:


{
  "$schema": "https://mintlify.com/docs.json"
}
