# Zeus Documentation Style Guide

## Core Principles

- **Aim** Our aim with writing the docs is to help drive more usage of our platform
- **Brevity**: Be ruthlessly concise. Eliminate unnecessary words.
- **Clarity**: Use simple language. One idea per sentence.
- **Structure**: Follow consistent patterns. Use clear headings.
- **Journalistic Style**: Important information first. Details later.
- **Bottom line up front**: Flag the important information and takeaways up front
- **Limited Jargon**: Define technical terms on first use.

## Writing Style

### Voice and Tone
- Use active voice: "The function returns a value" not "A value is returned by the function"
- Write in present tense: "The API sends a response" not "The API will send a response"
- Address the reader directly using second person ("you")
- Be conversational but professional

### Language
- Avoid excessive claims ("best", "fastest", "easiest")
- Write for a global audience (avoid idioms, colloquialisms)
- Use inclusive language (avoid gendered terms)
- Limit contractions to maintain clarity

## Content Structure

### Headings
- Use sentence case: "Getting started with the API" not "Getting Started With The API"
- Keep headings brief and descriptive
- Use a logical hierarchy (H1 > H2 > H3)
- Avoid skipping heading levels

### Paragraphs
- One main idea per paragraph
- Get straight to the point. 
- Start the paragraph with a clear topic sentence 
- Use bullet points for lists of 3+ items
- Don't include fluff like "XXX is very important" or "things are becoming increasingly XXX"

### Code Examples
- Keep examples minimal and focused
- Include comments for complex sections
- Use consistent formatting and indentation
- Ensure examples are complete and functional

## Formatting

### Text Formatting
- Use **bold** for UI elements and emphasis
- Use *italics* sparingly for introduced terms
- Use `code font` for code, commands, and file names
- Avoid ALL CAPS except for acronyms

### Lists
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Use bullet lists for non-sequential items
- Keep list items parallel in structure
- Start each item in a list with an action word

### Links
- Use descriptive link text: "View pricing details" not "Click here"
- Make it clear where links lead
- Ensure all links are functional

## Upselling
- Include exactly one call-to-action per page
- Place it strategically (end of relevant section or page)
- Make the value proposition clear
- Use action-oriented language

## Images and Media
- Include alt text for all images
- Keep screenshots focused on relevant UI
- Use diagrams for complex concepts
- Optimize image sizes for fast loading

## Final Checks
- Proofread for spelling and grammar
- Verify technical accuracy
- Check for consistency with other documentation
- Ensure all links work
