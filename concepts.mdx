Zeus defines 4 key steps in the agent building process:
1. [Build](#build)
2. [Test](#test)
3. [Deploy](#deploy)
4. [Monitor](#monitor)

## Build

The Build step is where you create the agent. This is where you define what the agent does, what it knows, and what it can and can't do. 

Think of building your agent like writing instructions for a smart junior in college. In order to get the best results, it's important to be really specific. 



Why would you build an agent versus just hire a junior in college? Well, your agent works 24/7, speaks every language, is infinitely scalable, incredibly patient, and way cheaper. 

## Test

The Test step is where you evaluate your agent's performance against real world test-cases. For instance, if you're evaluating a customer support agent, you might create a test-case that simulates a customer who is angry and frustrated to see how the agent responds. 

The Test step is not mandatory, however, it is highly recommended. In order to feel confident that your agent is performing well and not hallucinating, you should test it against a variety of test-cases.

## Deploy

The Deploy step is where you deploy the agent. This is the most important step in the process.

## Monitor

The Monitor step is where you monitor the agent. This is the most important step in the process.
